Hello fellow humans,

Brandon here, Im am still in the process of learining: html, css, and javascript within the last few months. It is ALOT to take in but is all very interesting.
Having a bachelors degree in the INFOSEC field is a very tedious task as the job market for only a gradute and not a "technically" savvy person is not very kind to the likes of someone such as myself. Learing how to code seems like a much more feasible task at this point.
